==== Cache Plugin Rewritten

The http://plugins.grails.org/plugin/grails/cache[Cache Plugin] has been rewritten and no loader use proxies which improves startup time and performance. The plugin is also now http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#multiTenancy[Multi-Tenant] aware, ensuring that cached data is not seen by other tenants.


==== Converters plugin now Separate

With http://views.grails.org[JSON Views] now being the recommended way to render JSON. The converters plugin has been split out from core into https://github.com/grails-plugins/grails-plugin-converters[a separate project].
