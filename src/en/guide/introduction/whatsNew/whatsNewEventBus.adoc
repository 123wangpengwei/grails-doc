The link:{asyncdocs}[Grails Async Framework] has been extracted from Grails and moved to a separate project.

This allows the Async support to evolve independent of the framework itself in a fast moving and evolving area.

In order to support multiple different asynchronous and reactive frameworks Grails 3.3 has been decoupled from Reactor 2.x and an abstract `EventBus` notation added.

The link:{asyncdocs}/api/grails/events/bus/EventBus.html[EventBus] interface provides the foundation and multiple implementations including GPars and RxJava.

A new set of annotations usable in services classes and regular Spring beans can be leveraged to publish and consume events:

* link:{asyncdocs}/api/grails/events/annotation/Publisher.html[Publisher] - A transformation that transforms a method ensuring the return value is published as an event
* link:{asyncdocs}/api/grails/events/annotation/Subscriber.html[Subscriber] - A transformation that transforms a method to listen for an event.

For more information see link:{asyncdocs}/guide/index.html#events[the new documentation].
